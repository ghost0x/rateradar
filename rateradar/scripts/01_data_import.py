Purpose: Load the CSV file into a suitable data structure, like a pandas DataFrame in Python.
Tasks: This module would handle tasks like reading the CSV file, dealing with 
encoding issues if any, and initially validating the structure of the data (e.g., checking column names and counts).

Output: A raw DataFrame ready for cleaning and preprocessing.

NOTE: 
All data has been imported manually to data/raw.
View the README.md for more information of data sources and links.
